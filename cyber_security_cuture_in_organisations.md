##  Cyber Security Cuture in Organisations

### Reference
- ENISA

### Definitions

- Cybersecurity Culture (CSC) of organizations refers to the knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, attitudes,assumptions, norms and values of people regarding cybersecurity and how they manifest in people’s behaviour with information technologies. 

-  CSC is about making information security considerations an integral part of an employee’s job, habits and conduct, embedding them in their day-to-day actions.

- Adopting the right approach to information security enables a resilient CSC to develop naturally from the behaviours and attitudes of employees towards information assets at work, and as part of a company’s wider organisational culture, its CSC can be shaped, directed and transformed.

### Need for CSC
- The majority of data breaches within organisations are the result of human actors,and while cybersecurity policies are commonplace among organisations, employees may view them as guidelines rather than rules.

- Technologies cannot protect organisations if incorrectly integrated and utilised.

### Developing and implementing a successful CSC programme
- There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach

- Setup CSC Working Group comprising of
    - Information Security
    - Human Resource
· · · Human resources (HR) have an important role as a connector between management and employees. Thanks to their position within an organisational, HR can offer insights into the behaviour and psyche of employees, which in turn can be used to counter potential insider threats or design and deliver effective security education programmes. The department can also ensure that everyone in the organisation undergoes the necessary security training by enforcing compliance while conducting security practice evaluations of employees and, where necessary, enacting disciplinary sanctions.
