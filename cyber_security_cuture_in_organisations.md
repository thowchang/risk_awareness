##  Cyber Security Cuture in Organisations

### Reference
- ENISA

### Definitions

- Cybersecurity Culture (CSC) of organizations refers to the knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, attitudes,assumptions, norms and values of people regarding cybersecurity and how they manifest in people’s behaviour with information technologies. 

-  CSC is about making information security considerations an integral part of an employee’s job, habits and conduct, embedding them in their day-to-day actions.

- Adopting the right approach to information security enables a resilient CSC to develop naturally from the behaviours and attitudes of employees towards information assets at work, and as part of a company’s wider organisational culture, its CSC can be shaped, directed and transformed.

### Need for CSC
- The majority of data breaches within organisations are the result of human actors,and while cybersecurity policies are commonplace among organisations, employees may view them as guidelines rather than rules.

- Technologies cannot protect organisations if incorrectly integrated and utilised.
