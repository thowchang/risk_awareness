### Cyber Security Culture

This concept of culture can encompass repeated behaviours, group norms, embedded skills or shared
meanings. culture can be divided into three levels that interact together:
(1) promoted values, 
(2) visible behaviours, and 
(3) the underlying assumptions we hold.
An organisationâ€™s culture transformation should begin with a change in values, leading to the adoption of new behaviour. If that behaviour is successful in solving a problem, it will likely be adopted permanently.
