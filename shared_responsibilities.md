offering guidance and accepted standards for employee behaviour. Both acceptable and unacceptable
behaviour should be defined in line with the organization’s wishes and encouraged or denounced
respectively. If sanctions are enforced, consistency in their application is needed to ensure compliance and
influence changes in the mindsets of employees.
